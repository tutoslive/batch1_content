#### Sublime Text setup
I use Sublime Text as my code editor. It is free, easy and slick to use. Follow the steps to install sublime text
- Click [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) and select your operating system to download
- Click on the downloaded file and follow the instructions to install

#### Github setup
Github is an online platform for code versioning and distribution. Using github you can keep your code online from any where and can work from anywhere. It also gives the flexibility of versioning in your code and helps in collaborating with teams. At Tutoslive, we use github for course content, assignments, projects and examples.
You will be given a paid account (Tutoslive pays for it) and you can share your repo (only project and assignments) with your friends, family, recruiters and anyone.
More about github will be explained in the demo.

#### Slack setup
Slack is a great tool for communication between groups and individuals. At Tutoslive we use Slack to share knowledge, answer questions, collaborate on projects and discuss anything that can help us learn more. Also slack makes it easy to share screenshots, code snippets and great notifications. More about slack will be explained in the demo.

#### HTML program
I wanted to show a small demo of a HTML program. In fact, it is a small javascript program and I call it as 'Chase the rabbit' and it will be fun. I will also explain how it is done.
